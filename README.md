This project aims to use the restaurant tips dataset to practice creating composition plots and visualizations. We will examine the relationship between different variables and the tips given.

The dataset consists of information from 244 restaurant bills, collected in the US in 1987.

It includes details about the tips given to restaurant staff, such as the total bill, tip amount, gender of the person paying, smoking status, day of the week, time of day, and party size.
Source of the data is from Swiss coding academy
Load data from the following link: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/RusAbk/sca_datasets/main/tips.csv

We calculate the tip figures between the two customer files. And we categorize the datas to be compared as follows:
* Smokers and non-smokers
* Male and Female
* Weekends and weekdays
* Lunch and dinner ( *We checked data about time column, and the result is the restaurant only has 2 service times*)

**The main goal of this analysis:**
The restaurant wants to improve the quality of service, target the target customers to bring more income to the restaurant staff.
We need to find out the potential customers who can tip more to the staff, The service time that customers prefer, And when customers come to the restaurant the most.
